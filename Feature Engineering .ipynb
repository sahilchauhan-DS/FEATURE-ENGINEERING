What is a parameter?\n","\n","Ans: A parameter is a variable in a model that is learned from trained data.\n","\n","2. What is correlation?\n"," What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","Ans:Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship betweeen two variables.\n","\n","negative correlation means that as one variable increases the other decreases.\n","\n","\n","3.  Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n","\n","Ans: Machine learing means systems learning patterns from the data . components: data , model , loss function etc...\n","\n","4.  How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n","\n","Ans: A low loss value indicates better model performance.\n","\n","5.  What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","\n","Ans: Continuous means numerical values and categorical means string values.\n","\n","6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n","\n","Ans:we will convert the cathegorical data into numerical data. One- Hot Encoding , label Encoding.\n","\n","7.  What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n","\n","Ans:  training means learning the models from the data and testing means evaluating the unseen data.\n","\n","8.  What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n","\n","Ans: A module in scikit-learn for preprocessing data like scaling and encoding.\n","\n","9.  What is a Test set?\n","\n","Ans:  A subset of data used to evaluate the model after training.\n","\n","10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n"," How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n","\n","Ans: Use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.\n","Define problem , gather data , preprocess , model , evaluate , deploy.\n","\n","11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n","\n","Ans:  To understand data patterns, detect outliers and choose features.\n","\n","12. What is correlation?\n","\n","Ans: It is used to find the strenght and direction between two relational varaibles.\n","\n","13. What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","Ans: IF one variable increases another variable is decreases is an negative correlation.\n","\n","14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Using np.corr() or sns.heatmap()\n","\n","\n","15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example?\n","\n","Ans: causation means one variable causes another.\n","\n","Correlation menas finding the relation between two variables.\n","\n","16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.?\n","\n","Ans:  Optimizers adjust weights to minimize loss.\n","Types: GD, SGD, Adam , RMSprop.\n","1. GD: (Gradiant Descent): Updates weighrs in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss.\n","2. SGD-(Stochastic gradient descent): Using one random sample at a time.\n","3. ADAM - (Adaptive Moment Estimation): Combines momentum and RMSprop .\n","4. RMSprop: Adapts learning rate using a moving average of squared gradients.\n","\n","17. What is sklearn.linear_model ?\n","\n","Ans: A module with linear models like LinearRegression and logisticRegression.\n","\n","18. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n","\n","Ans: Trains the model on data . it needs features and labels.\n","\n","19. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n","\n","Ans: Makes predictions on new data. Needs input features.\n","\n","20. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","\n","Ans: Continuous means numerical values eg: 1,2 ,10, 45.3 etc and categorical means string values eg: Hi , Bangalore , First etc...\n","\n","21. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n","\n","Ans: Rescales features to a common scale. Helps models converge faster.\n","\n","22. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n","\n","Ans: using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.\n","\n","23. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n","\n","Ans:A module in scikit-learn for preprocessing data like scaling and encodi\n","\n","24. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n","\n","Ans:Use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.\n","\n","25. Explain data encoding?\n","\n","Ans: It converts cathegorical data into numerical data.\n","eg: One- hot encoding ,Label encoding\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Tvtdyr955Ob8"}}]}
